Just a little fun OS simulator.
PLEASE INSTALL THESE TO C:\
OTHERWISE IT WONT WORK PROPERLY BECAUSE IT'S LITERALLY C:\gptos
RUN os_installer.py TO SIMULATE THE INSTALLATION PROCESS! THIS WONT ALSO ACTUALLY INSTALL FILES AND FOLDERS ON YOUR DESKTOP TOO
Once it's done, run os.py :) Have fun!

How to use:
Click one of the buttons in the taskbar.
If you select Start Menu, maybe click on a button icon.
Programs, maybe yes.
There's too much to explain so, figure it out yourself!

Fact: Minesweeper is a game in Python I wrote, it doesn't even use pygame either.
